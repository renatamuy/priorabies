### Cost Layer
Value for each municipality that reflects the cost of intervention based on hospital proximity (i.e., higher cost for areas far from hospitals).

### Benefit layer
Indicates the relative rabies risk. Higher values mean that intervening there would yield a higher benefit in terms of reducing rabies risk in the future.
